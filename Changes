Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::Twofish2

1.01 Thu Mar  3 18:00:52 CET 2005
	- change of contact address.

1.0  Wed Jul 14 17:55:13 CEST 2004
	- minor spelling mistakes.
        - pad result with trailing (hidden) zero-byte to please regex code
          (problem reported by Andreas KÃ¶nig).

0.06  Fri Feb 23 02:12:22 CET 2001
	- fix TWO MAJOR BUGS. First, keys with a leading zero byte
          caused no encryption at all. Second, the keys were byte-swapped
          on BIG-ENDIAN machines (or rather, not swapped at all).

          Both of these bugs were corrected. If you have old keys on
          big-endian machine you can get the old behaviour by applying the
          following regex to your key:

          $key =~ s/(.)(.)(.)(.)/$4$3$2$1/gs;
          
        - added more test vectors that should also catcg endianness-issues.
        - minor portability fixes.

0.05  Mon Feb 19 09:08:12 CET 2001
	- workaround for the 5.004 pod anomaly.
        - renamed twofish2.c to twofish.c to avoid name clash on the
          lesser os's ;) actually, the old name was a bug anyway.

0.04  Tue Jan 16 13:59:00 CET 2001
	- better test for little endian (should work on alpha now).
        - more(?) 5.004 compatibility (5.004 is still unsupported). I
          wished people wouldn't insist on using ANTIQUE versions of their
          software with my module.

0.03  Tue Aug  1 22:05:05 CEST 2000
	- added SvPV_nolen emulation for stoneage perls (5.5 and below).

0.02  Sun Apr  9 02:54:32 CEST 2000
	- use BYTEORDER form perl.h
        - improved testsuite

0.01  Fri Apr  7 11:24:43 CEST 2000
	- original version; leftover "garbage" from the PApp module
