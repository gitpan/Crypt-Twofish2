Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::Twofish2

0.04  Tue Jan 16 13:59:00 CET 2001
	- better test for little endian (should work on alpha now).
        - more(?) 5.004 compatibility (5.004 is still unsupported). I
          wished people wouldn't insist on using ANTIQUE versions of their
          software with my module.

0.03  Tue Aug  1 22:05:05 CEST 2000
	- added SvPV_nolen emulation for stoneage perls (5.5 and below).

0.02  Sun Apr  9 02:54:32 CEST 2000
	- use BYTEORDER form perl.h
        - improved testsuite

0.01  Fri Apr  7 11:24:43 CEST 2000
	- original version; leftover "garbage" from the PApp module
